## How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/avion-project.git
   cd avion-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

## Project Structure

- **/components**: Contains all React components like Header, Footer, HeroSection, etc.
- **/pages**: Contains all route-based pages for the app.
- **/public**: Holds images, icons, and other static files.
- **/styles**: Contains global styles, including Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styles.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Responsive Design**: One of the main challenges was ensuring that the layout is fluid and responsive across all screen sizes. I had to fine-tune the Tailwind breakpoints and utilize `flex`, `grid`, and `space-x`/`space-y` classes to ensure the design was adaptable.
   
2. **Image Optimization**: Integrating and optimizing images with Next.js's `<Image />` component posed some issues. I needed to ensure images were correctly sized and optimized for performance, which required specific handling of the `width`, `height`, and `src` properties.

3. **State Management**: Managing state for dynamic components, like the cart, was another challenge. Initially, I used props, but later switched to React Context for better state management across the app.

4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the design works across different browsers, especially for specific CSS properties like `flexbox`, required additional testing and fixes.

## Errors Encountered

1. **Missing or Incorrect Tailwind Classes**: Early on, I faced issues where certain styles werenâ€™t being applied because I had forgotten to include some Tailwind classes, or made syntax errors with them.
   
2. **SEO/Accessibility Issues**: Ensuring that the website was accessible and SEO-friendly was difficult at first. I had to add proper alt attributes to all images and use semantic HTML tags.

3. **SVG Icon Issues**: Initially, I had trouble with SVG icons not displaying correctly in some places. Replacing them with standard images solved the issue, but later, I returned to using SVGs with proper `viewBox` and `xmlns` attributes.
